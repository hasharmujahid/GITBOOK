# ‚ùî Whoami

**Hi** ! My name is [Hashar Mujahid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hashar-mujahid-7223181a3/) and I am a security researcher.

I like to play CTF's on various platforms like [HACK THE BOX](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/927426), [TRY HACK ME](https://tryhackme.com/p/HasharMujahid), and most OG one [VULNHUB](https://www.vulnhub.com/). This Website will hold all of my notes and usefull commands. You can also contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Mujahid\_Hashar).

I created this gitbook to publish my writeups and methodology to solve CTF's and exploit vulnerabilities in systems.
